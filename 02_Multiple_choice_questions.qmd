In this Chapter, we have included information about the Multiple Choice Quiz in RM2. You can use the menu at the right hand side of this page to jump to the different sections.

## General Information

-   The deadline for this assessment can be found under 'Assessment Summary' within the 'Course Information' section on the RM2 Moodle.

-   This assessment is worth 10% of your final course grade.

**Please note:** The MCQ will open up one week before the deadline. Please ensure you have reviewed the Week 1-14 lecture content before taking the MCQ.

## Type of Assessment/Structure

-   All the information needed to answer the Multiple choice questions will have been covered in the research methods lectures between Weeks 1 and 14.

    -   The MCQ will assess different types of content:
        -   Knowledge of quantitative content covered in the lectures
        -   Understanding of different quantitative research designs\
        -   Knowledge of qualitative content covered in the lectures

-   The MCQ will be provided through a submission link on Moodle. The submission link will be made available one week before the deadline.

-   There are 22 questions and each MCQ will have four options - the answer will be one of these.

-   Each question will be presented on a single page. There are many reasons for this, including that having multiple questions on a page increases moodle loading times, slowing it down.

-   You will have 40 minutes to complete the MCQ. If you are registered with disability services for extra time it should show longer than this. If the quiz does not display additional completion time when you click on the link, please contact Admin or Ashley/Wil to let them know.

## Assessment Support
