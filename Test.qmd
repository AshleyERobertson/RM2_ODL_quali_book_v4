### Submission 2: Step-by-step Evidence of the Analysis Process

This year, we are asking that all students in RM2 complete two separate submissions for their qualitative report. 

- Submission 1 = full report with cover sheet and appendices
- Submission 2 = step-by-step evidence of your Reflexive Thematic Analysis

Submission 2 will be formally assessed [through the fourth ILO in ‘Evaluation’.](#report_ILOs)

The reasons for this requirement are three-fold:

- **To support your learning of rigorous qualitative research skills.**
    
    Reflexive Thematic Analysis (RTA) relies on transparency, reflexivity, and a clear audit trail of decisions. By documenting each step, you gain a deeper understanding of how qualitative analysis works and build skills that are essential for doing high-quality research.
    
- **To ensure that your submitted work reflects your own analytic thinking.**
    
    We know that generative AI tools are now widely accessible, and while they can be useful for support, they cannot replace the reflective, interpretive, and creative thinking at the heart of RTA. Taking the process step-by-step helps you to demonstrate your genuine engagement with the data and protects the integrity of your work.
    
- **To help you experience RTA as a process, not just a product.**
    
    Good RTA is not about producing a set of themes; it is about the journey you take to get there. Keeping a portfolio helps you slow down, think critically, and make your analytic decisions visible. This will lead to richer insights and a stronger final analysis.
    

In short, we hope that this requirement for keeping a transparent record of your analytic journey will help you produce stronger work and deepen your understanding of qualitative research.

[The template can be found here]([Thematic analysis process document template.docx](https://gla-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/ashley_robertson_glasgow_ac_uk/EcwNeR1TcCpAi1inMtQgB3cBkucx3-cH3LO-Mk2fseBkOQ?e=LEfvVw))

**Answers to some potential questions**

- **What advice do you have for completing this process?** Our main piece of advice is to work on the reflexivity diary (part of the appendices) and the ‘evidencing the process’ template *while you are working on the project*. You should be completing these steps anyway as part of the analysis, so it should be a case of logging the evidence as you go. If, however, you do not complete it as you go along, this would make it very difficult to include properly at the last minute.
- **Can I use NVivo?** For this assignment, no. We plan to develop guidance that considers how students can best use NVivo in the age of GenAI, but this will take a lot of time to develop. 
- **I developed three themes, but can only report two in the qual report itself: What do I do?** It probably makes sense to include all of the information up until the end of Phase 4, as often the themes are intermingled together. However, for the Phase 5 part (naming and defining the themes), it is up to you: you can include all of your themes or you can include only those that are in the report.

Below, we have prepared some guidance for each section to help you. 

#### Phase 1: Familiarisation

::: {.callout-important}

## Phase 1: What is asked for?

In the template, we ask for your familiarisation notes, when you read through each transcript. 
:::

**Guidelines for Phase 1**

Familiarity notes are brief reflections written while reading and re-reading the data. They are often messy and very personal and are not ‘right’ or ‘wrong’.

They tend to capture:

- First impressions
- What stands out
- What seems confusing or unusual
- Emotional reactions
- Questions or curiosities
- Early ideas about what the participant might be “doing” with their words
- Noticing of tone, contradictions, or patterns

Some things you might note down: 

- What immediately grabs your attention?
- How do you feel in response to what you’re reading?
- What do you think the participant is trying to express? Why do you think this?
- Are any ideas or experiences repeated?
- Do they say things that don’t fit together?
- What are you curious about? What would you ask them if you could?
- Anything about their background that shapes how you read this?
- How do your assumptions/interests shape what seems important?

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}

## Example

This is a short example of a familiarisation note, to give you a sense of what might be expected.

*“My first impression is that Participant 1 feels overwhelmed but also quite capable, which creates an interesting tension. Words like ‘pressure’, ‘everyone watching’, and ‘expectations’ make me think they’re under a lot of stress. I notice I feel a bit anxious reading this - maybe because I’ve had similar experiences. I’m also interested in their comment about ‘putting on a front’ at work. It makes me wonder why they feel they can’t be their real self in that situation.”*

This familiarity note captures initial impressions, points to specific language that shaped those impressions, and reflects openly on personal reactions while reading. It also highlights moments that stood out and raises gentle questions, showing curiosity rather than early analysis.

#### Phase 2: Developing Codes

::: {.callout-important}

## Phase 2: What is asked for?

In the template, we ask for you to provide a table with all of your codes in it. 
:::

**TALK TO WIL AND ADD IN GUIDANCE ABOUT THE TABLE**

**Guidelines for Phase 2**

When coding, think about the following: 

- Work through your data section by section, thinking about what feels meaningful, interesting or like there is a pattern
- Create short labels (codes) that capture the essence of what each highlighted section is *doing*, *saying*, or *representing*
- Remember that you can be flexible with the coding process. You can create as many codes as you need, and you can merge or rename them later. This allows you to remain responsive as your coding develops over the dataset.
- Try to keep your coding active and interpretive, focusing on meaning instead of counting how often something appears.
- If you are unsure whether to code something or not, err on the side of caution and include it. This will help you avoid overlooking sections that seem contradictory, subtle, or hard to interpret
- Keep a note of your reflections in your reflexivity diary as you code, which will help in later phases.

#### Phase 3: Generating initial themes

::: {.callout-important}

## Phase 3: What is asked for?

In the template, we ask you to a) tell us about your initial themes and/or subthemes, b) tell us the process of how you developed these, and c) tell us about the initial patterns you observed.
:::

In this section, you start to group together your codes into themes. Some parts might come together nicely and others might feel more difficult to put into groups. This is part of the process and nothing to worry about! 

**Guidelines for Phase 3**

When forming your initial themes, think about the following:

- Look across all your codes and identify broader meaning-based patterns.
- Group together codes that seem related, connected, or part of a shared story.
- Notice similarities, differences, tensions, and recurring ideas across your coded data. Sometimes you can have themes that look contradictory on the surface, but there is shared meaning underneath.
- Create rough theme names that capture the central idea or organising concept in each cluster.
- Write a short description of what each initial theme is about and why it matters.
- Write reflections about how you developed the theme (e.g., repeated emotions, shared experiences, contradictions you observed).
- Remember these are **initial** themes - this is not the final version and they can change, merge, or be dropped in later phases.

#### Phase 4: Developing and Reviewing Themes

::: {.callout-important}

## Phase 4: What is asked for?

In the template, we ask for you to provide details of how your themes changed from the initial themes you identified in Phase 3.
:::

In this section, this is where you really think about what your themes **mean**, and how they relate to each other. There is often some back-and-forth during this part of the process, and students often end up going back to Phase 3 (or even 2). 

**Guidelines for Phase 4**

- Revisit the coded extracts for each theme and check whether they *truly* fit together and reflect a coherent idea.
- Look for any extracts that feel out of place, unclear, or better suited to a different theme — or that suggest a new theme.
- Refine each theme’s focus by clarifying its central organising concept: what is the core meaning holding this theme together?
- Check whether themes are too broad, too narrow, overlapping, or repetitive, and adjust by splitting, combining, or renaming.
- Review themes against the *full dataset* to ensure they capture important patterns across the data, not just isolated points.
- Consider whether any parts of the dataset have been overlooked or require revisiting earlier phases of coding or theme development.
- Make notes about how your themes changed (e.g., merged, refined, expanded) and why these changes improved the analysis.
- Ensure each theme tells a meaningful, distinct part of the overall story you are constructing about the data.

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}

## Example

This is a short example of how themes might change from Phase 3 to Phase 4, to give you a sense of what might be expected.

**Initial Theme (Phase 3):** “Feeling Under Pressure”

- Developed from a cluster of codes including “pressure to perform”, “fear of being judged”, and “trying to keep up”.
- It seemed to be apparent that participants were describing feeling stressed and overwhelmed by expectations.

**Refinement Process (Phase 4)** 

- When reviewing coded extracts, I noticed that some excerpts were more about *external expectations* (e.g., others judging them), while others were about *internal expectations* (e.g., pushing themselves).
- This suggested that my initial theme was too broad, and actually captured two different patterns, so I split the theme into two themes.
- I changed the names to better reflect the differences between these themes.

**Refined Themes (Phase 4):** Theme 1: "Navigating Others' Judgements" and Theme 2: "Holding Myself to High Standards"

1. “Navigating Others’ Judgements”

  - This theme captures experiences of being watched, evaluated, or compared to others, reflecting a concern about how others perceive the participant.

2. “Holding Myself to High Standards”**

  - This theme reflects participants’ self-imposed pressure, perfectionism, and high standards.

:::

#### Phase 5: Refining, Defining and Naming Themes

::: {.callout-important}

## Phase 5: What is asked for?

In the template, we ask to a) tell us how you came up with your theme names and b) provide a definition for your theme/s. 
:::

In this section, this is where you aim to clearly articulate what each theme is about, define its boundaries, and give it a meaningful name that captures its central organising concept.

**Guidelines**

- Revisit each theme and identify its central organising concept ****(the key idea that holds the theme together).
- Write a clear explanation of what each theme is about, focusing on the shared meaning across the extracts, not just the topic.
- Know the boundaries of the theme - what belongs in it and what does not? One suggestion is to tell someone who doesn’t know your research about your theme.
- Check that each theme is distinct from the others and not overlapping, repetitive, or too similar in focus.
- Refine the name of the theme so it captures its core meaning in a concise, engaging, and conceptually clear way. Avoid one word theme names or names that are very descriptive.
- Write a brief description of how each theme contributes to your overall analysis.
- Ensure each theme connects back to your research question and supports the analytical narrative you are building.

#### Coded transcripts

Here, we ask that you provide all of your transcripts that have been coded (we advise two or three, with a max of four if doing the couples dataset). If you have coded the transcripts multiple times, please only include one set of transcripts. 

::: {.callout-important}

## Coded transcripts: What is asked for?

In the template, we ask for you to provide all of your coded transcripts. These should either be commented in Word or scans of physical copies.
