Please make sure to familiarise yourself with the [Assessment Information](#ch4_AIS_report) before starting to work on the report. We have also provided a [suggested timeline](https://gla-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/ashley_robertson_glasgow_ac_uk/EQM2Fzsi0FJAlDKTJXgi7-8Brm7ITIBw5ta3MaXSiDZfrg?e=FMLoM4){target=\"_blank\"} for the qualitative report and portfolio\n\nFor this assignment, you will be asked to write an individual qualitative report on one of five secondary data topics. You should conduct Thematic Analysis on your chosen dataset. A video on the Qualitative report will be provided on Moodle (look in the materials for Semester 1 Week 1). We provide guidelines on the report [later in this chapter](#qual_report_guide)\n\n## Report datasets and how to use UK data service\n\nBefore accessing your datasets, watch [this video](https://echo360.org.uk/media/ac815f47-bb97-40cc-8c34-d82d74e4bb0e/public){target=\"_blank\"} on how to use UK data service. It shows you an example of how to download the data with one of the datasets. Please note that some of the datasets are on sensitive topics, and contain information that may be upsetting: make sure to familiarise yourself with the interview schedules and have a quick scan of the data before you decide which dataset to work with. \n\n[The UK data service can be accessed here](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/myaccount/login){target=\"_blank\"}\n\nYou can choose one of the five available datasets: \n  \n  1. [Interviews with disabled young people and carers](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=854556){target=\"_blank\"}\n  2. [LGBT+ networks in the workplace](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=855322){target=\"_blank\"}\n  3. [Long-term relationships](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/851244/){target=\"_blank\"}\n  4. [Patient descriptions of PMS](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/855486/){target=\"_blank\"}\n  5. [Student experiences of loneliness and social connectedness](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/856114/){target=\"_blank\"}\n  \n\n## Developing a research question\n\nAs part of writing up your qualitative report, we ask that you develop a research question to help you guide your enquiry. Below, we have some guidance on how to get started.\n\n### Getting started with the data\n\nFor this report, you are using secondary data. This means that the data have already been collected - before you start thinking about your research question, have a look at the interviews to see what was asked in the interviews. Usually, most interviews are semi-structured. This means that there are likely to be some questions asked consistently, but there will also be differences, depending on the responses by the participants. \n\nLooking at the data before you decide on your RQ might feel a bit strange after RM1, but remember that you are not doing hypothesis-testing with qualitative designs - it is quite normal for a qualitative research question to change during the research process, and this is completely fine as you are not statistically testing for a specific effect.\n\nBe mindful that you are not making a research question that is actually one of the interview questions - your RQ should be broader than an interview question.\n\nOne of the most common mistakes that students make when framing their research question in RM2 is that it is a little too 'quant' in nature. This makes perfect sense, as most of your research methods education so far in the programme has been focused on quant! However, for your qual report, your RQ should be a little different to the RQs you are used to. \n\nLook at the following examples:\n\n1. How does poor sleep impact on wellbeing? \n2. What is the difference in wellbeing between those who belong to university and those who don't?\n\nBoth questions are a bit too quantitative in nature (i.e. 1 is causal and 2 is about a difference between groups). They would also benefit from thinking about what is being looked at, specifically (e.g. views, opinions, experiences).\n\nWe'd perhaps rephrase these as follows:\n\n1.  What are students' perceptions of the relationship between sleep and wellbeing?\n2. What are online conversion students' experiences of belonging to University? How do these experiences relate to perceived wellbeing?\n\nThese questions are now a bit more in line with qualitative and are specific about what they are asking in each (and also what the group of interest is). The second one covers a bit more than the first, which is why it is split into two (a main RQ and a subsidiary one)\n\n### Some tips for developing a research question\n\n  * **Communication:** Keep your research question simple and specific. If you have a very broad question, it can be helpful to break the question down into smaller sub-questions.\n  * **Type of question:**  We want the RQ to tap in to more than ‘descriptive’ experience but also offer scope to explore the ‘how’ and ‘why’ of psychological experience–Is the question asking about experiences, understanding, accounts of practice, or influencing factors?  \n  * **Practical constraints:** Can the question realistically be explored using thematic analysis and using secondary data? Try not to cover too much\n  * **Guiding:** Remember that your RQ guides your enquiry but shouldn't be restrictive  - it's not the case that you are unable to report themes that don't directly answer your RQ. \n  * **Flexibility:** Research questions are more flexible than hypotheses-it is acceptable for the focus of the RQ to be refined during/after data collection.\n  \n### Formative feedback on your RQ\n\nIf you would like to receive formative feedback on your RQ, you can submit it on [this Padlet](https://padlet.com/wilhelmiinatoivo/rm2-odl-research-questions-f844153314j3pwr2){target=\"_blank\"} by the end of Semester 2 Week 5. Please note that RQs submitted later than that will not receive feedback, and you would need to drop into office hours instead.\n\nIf you would like to discuss your RQ, you can also attend Ashley's and Wil's office hours.\n  \n\n## Qualitative report guide {#qual_report_guide}\n\nThis guide is intended to help you in the write up of your qualitative project report. When writing your report, remember to use the other resources available to you:\n\n  * Your feedback for your RM1 report\n  * Chapter 13 in [Braun & Clarke (2013)](https://go.exlibris.link/5g3nFfGx){target=\"_blank\"} is excellent support for writing up qualitative research\n  * [Braun & Clark (2022) book](https://go.exlibris.link/Z9qxllzH){target=\"_blank\"}\n  * All the resources available in this book (particularly sections for [8. Data analysis](#ch8_data_analysis) and [11. Academic writing](#c11_writing)\n  * **25/26 cohort reading list:**: [Published articles that use a Thematic Analysis](https://rl.talis.com/3/glasgow/lists/30BEDB96-5F9D-9F9E-630A-205B91FA34AB.html?lang=en-GB#B226C8C1-1926-8328-A8A3-06DC389D9809){target=\"_blank\"}\n  * [A helpful resource for APA formatting is OWL Purdue](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/general_format.html)\n  \nUse [the assessment criteria](#ch4_AIS_report) as a checklist before you submit the report, to ensure you have addressed all points.  If you have questions post on Teams and/or visit our office hours.  All the best in writing your report.\n\n### Required Submissions\n\nTwo separate submissions are required for this report: \n\n- **Submission 1** should contain the report itself, along with the specified sections and appendices. \n    - Cover page with title (does not count towards the word limit)\n    - Abstract\n    - Introduction\n    - Method\n    - Analysis\n    - Discussion\n    - References (does not count towards word limit)\n    - Appendices (does not count towards word limit)\n   \n    \n- **Submission 2** should contain the required information about the process of your analysis, using the template  provided. Submission 2 does not count towards the word limit.\n    - Phase 1 (Familiarisation)\n    - Phase 2 (Doing Coding)\n    - Phase 3 (Generating Initial Themes)\n    - Phase 4 (Developing and Reviewing Themes)\n    - Phase 5 (Refining, Defining and Naming Themes)\n    \n\n### Submission 1: The Qualitative Report\n\n#### General writing style\n\n- Your writing should be clear, concise and easy to follow - remember that academic writing does not need to be complicated to be good. One tip is to [use word to read your report back to you](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/listen-to-your-word-documents-5a2de7f3-1ef4-4795-b24e-64fc2731b001){target=\"_blank\"} – sometimes it’s easier to hear where a point may be overly complex or long and where you might want to cut it down.\n\n- Maintain a neutral, academic tone throughout. Avoid a ‘journalistic’ tone, where you convince the reader based on using emotive language. Instead, show the reader why you think the way you do and the evidence base that underlies this.\n\n- Discuss one idea/argument per paragraph. An excellent resource to help with this is the [reverse outline](https://explorationsofstyle.com/2011/02/09/reverse-outlines/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n- You should format your headings, in-text citations and references in APA 7th style. \n- APA writing style encourages the use of active voice (“I coded the data” rather than “the data were coded”) but if you feel more comfortable writing in passive voice, feel free to do so - just make sure to be consistent throughout and be careful not to make your writing overly complex.\n\n- Tenses are not always fixed per se (as it depends on how a sentence is structured). However, generally, the following applies – past tense should be used when you have done something already (like your study). For example, we would usually see past tense in the Methods (unless doing a registered report) and the Analysis section. When talking about papers that are already published (in the Intro and Discussion), again these would typically be in past tense. \n\n- You can use first person singular (I) or plural (we) in the report itself if you want to, but in the reflexivity section make sure to write in first person singular. This is because this is your reflection of your own positionality to the RQ and the data, and it’s often very personal.\n\n\n#### Title\n\nThe title should be included as part of the cover page. It should reflect the research question(s) and define your sample (e.g., UG students experience of…). Try to be specific - your title should include: \n\n  * Who\n  * What \n  * How \n\n**Examples:**\n\n  * A Thematic Analysis *(how)* of the panic attack experiences *(what)* of primary aged children in inner city Schools in the UK *(who)*\n  * Barriers and enablers to modifying sleep behaviour *(what)* in adolescents and young adults *(who)*: A qualitative investigation *(how)*\n\n#### Abstract (suggested word count: 100-150 words)\n\nIn an academic journal, the function of an abstract is to give readers a snapshot of the whole paper. They then use this to decide whether or not to read the full article. Therefore, you should make sure you cover all four main sections of your report, summarising them all succinctly.\n\nAim to summarise all sections of the report in 150 words, including;  1) what does the existing literature tell us about the topic 2) aim of the study 3) brief methodology, 4) approach to analysis , 5) main findings, and 6) key aspects of the discussion. Keep in mind that you are summarising your research for a non-expert and you want to “entice” them to read more.\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse=\"false\"}\n## Tips\n- Start out by writing four sentences, each summarising one section of the report (introduction, methods, analysis, discussion). Now, look at the six sections above and see where you might need to add a bit of detail.\n- One common mistake is to ignore the discussion, saying something like 'Findings are discussed in relation to existing research'. This doesn't tell us anything about what your overarching thoughts are about your findings and how they relate to the literature base.\n:::\n\n#### Introduction (suggested word count 750-850 words)\n\nSome activities to support you with writing your Analysis section can be found in [Chapter 11](#eval_intro).\n\nThe introduction should give readers enough background to understand your rationale for further research, whether your study is qualitative or quantitative. Provide a clear, critical review of the most relevant published research and highlight the key issues and debates in the field. Use these to build a logical argument for your study.\n\nFollow the APA-style funnel structure: begin with a broad overview of the topic, then narrow the focus until you reach your specific rationale and research question(s).\n\nBecause your word count is limited, focus on recent and directly relevant studies—especially the latest qualitative research in this specific area. Show how your project builds on the most recent work to strengthen your rationale. Remember to cite all sources used, including government reports, websites, and media items.\n\nA resource for helping you to develop evaluation in your introductions can be found at the start of [Chapter 11](#ch11_writing).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Broad-to-narrow structure of an introduction](images/intro.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\nYou should end with a statement of what the aim of your study was, and the research question.\n\n\nWhen reviewing previous studies, don't just describe them - evaluate them. Highlight their limitations, but only those your study can realistically address. Consider what the findings mean, note any conflicting results, and think about why they differ. This should naturally build toward a clear rationale for your own study.\n\nThen, explain your study and clearly state your research question(s), ensuring they connect directly to the issues raised in your introduction.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Review and critically evaluate relevant theories and research.\n- Justify your study by linking gaps or limitations in past work to your research questions.\n- Clearly outline your main and subsidiary research questions, ensuring these are phrased in a way that aligns with a qualitative approach.\n\nRemember: just like in a quantitative report, this section shows what has been done before and why your study is needed.\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse=\"false\"}\n## Tips\n- In your rationale, remember to tell the reader why the current study (i.e. the topic and group of participants) is **important**. \n- If identifying limitations of existing research, make sure to pick something that you are able to address in your study. If you say that one issue is that heart rate wasn't gathered, but you don't do this in your study, this can be confusing for a reader.\n\n:::\n\n#### Method (suggested word count 350-450 words)\n\nThe aim of the method section is to clearly report how your study was conducted – the reader should be able to re-run your research from the details provided. In this case, contextualise the original study that your secondary data are from, report details of the original data collection, explain your process of refining and selecting the data used for your project, and describe the qualitative analysis you used. True ‘replication’ is difficult due to the central role of the researcher in influencing some aspects of the research such as analysis. This is not an experiment.\n\nFollow these subheadings for your method section for this report:\n\n**Secondary data**\n\nIn this section you should describe the original study and give the reader context about their data collection. Understanding the specific context of each study is a key element of qualitative research, which is why it is really important for you to explain that in order for your secondary analysis to be reported openly.\n\nWhat was the original study about? Who conducted it? Where are the data available? You should cite your chosen dataset in APA style (do not provide a link in text) - each dataset has this information on the UK data service page under the Citation and copyright section. How many interviews did they conduct, what was the methodology they used for the interviews (you should find this information on the UK Data Service page for your chosen data set)? Who were their participants? What were the participants asked about?\n\nIf you have demographic information about the participants on the UK Data Service Website, you may wish to include this, but don’t worry if your chosen dataset doesn’t provide this - we don’t expect you to report any information that was not available to you.\n\n**Data selection**\n\nIn this section you should describe your procedure for choosing your final data set. How many interviews did you choose? How did you choose the specific ones you decided to use for your analysis?\n\n**Ethics**\n\nThe information you are able to provide in this section will depend on the information made available within the dataset. Some things you might want to comment on include: anonymisation procedures (e.g. has information been replaced or redacted), rapport building, information/consent/debrief, consent as a process. You will only be able to include information that has been made available in the dataset, so do not worry if you do not know a lot of detail.\n\n**Reflexivity**\n\nIn qualitative research it is important to acknowledge the role of the researcher in interpretation of the data [(Elliot et al., 1999)](https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1348/014466599162782){target=\"_blank\"}. \n\nThis is where you question your own motives and attitudes in doing this project. Obviously we told you that you had to do it. But, what motivated you to choose the dataset you did? What assumptions did you hold prior to beginning the research? Had you considered issues around the topic previously? Did they match what the interviews say,  or did you disagree with them? Did this affect which interviews you chose to include in your analysis? And if so, how did this impact on your analysis? Because different people would interpret the data differently, it is useful for you to expose your own attitudes at this point so that others can see how you have impacted on the analysis. \n\nSee Braun & Clarke (2013, pp36-37, 303-304) and activities around reflexivity. Reflexive analysis should be concise for this project, perhaps around 3-4 sentences. However, you will also have to include a reflexive diary in your appendices.\n\n**Data Analysis**\n\nIn this section, explain:\n\n- What analysis method you used and your theoretical approach (see Semester 1, Week 6 for a reminder).\n- The stages of your qualitative analysis. Be clear and specific - qualitative work is sometimes criticised for being vague. Use recognised guidelines (e.g., Smith for IPA; Braun & Clarke for Reflexive Thematic Analysis).\n\nWhen outlining the stages:\n\n- Give a brief summary of the full process, linked to the relevant framework (e.g., RTA). Around three to four sentences total is enough for this length of report.\n- You can keep some phases short (e.g., “familiarisation with the data (Phase 1);  generating codes (Phase 2)…”).\n- Aim for transparency - explain what happens between coding and theme development.\n- Describe the researcher as actively identifying themes, not waiting for themes to “emerge,” which incorrectly suggests they are already there waiting to be found.\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse=\"false\"}\n\n## Tips\n\n- In the methods section, try to be precise and succinct in your writing (this applies to the whole report, but is particularly important here). Think about what the reader needs to know and how to best communicate this.\n- Common errors include inaccurate information (e.g. the wrong number of Phases in Braun & Clarke’s framework) and a superficial reflexivity section.\n\n:::\n  \n#### Analysis (suggested word count: 750-900 words)\n\nSome activities to support you with writing your Analysis section can be found in [Chapter 11](#eval_analysis).\n\nThe analysis section is where you present the evidence you’ve collected. It works like a Results section in a quantitative report.\n\nYour goal is to make the analysis transparent, showing clearly how your interpretations come from the transcripts. Use extracts from the transcripts to support all quotes and interpretations. \n\n**Guidelines**\n\n- Choose a maximum of two themes or one theme with two sub-themes to include in the Analysis section, even if you found more. You will not be able to go into enough depth if you present more themes than this, due to the word count restrictions. \n- If you want to use parts of a quote, rather than the full quote (e.g. maybe you want to remove the middle sentence, which doesn’t add anything), you can indicate you omitted something with ellipses. \n- Never alter any of the words or phrasing that is used, even if you think you know what the participant was going to say. This would be as unacceptable as editing numbers in a quantitative analysis! \n- Try to strike a balance between quotes and interpretation. We sometimes see lots of quotes with very little analysis or lots of analysis with very few quotes, both of which have problems.\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n\n## Generative AI and data\n\nDo not, **under any circumstances**, put the transcripts or quotes from the transcripts into GenerativeAI (this includes CoPilot). This will not have been agreed as part of the original ethics and participants will not have consented for this use of the data. \n\nFailing to follow these instructions puts you at risk of academic and research misconduct. \n\n:::\n\n**Structuring the Analysis section**\n\n- Start with a short paragraph summarising the main themes **without** using any quotes. This should not be too long - perhaps around a sentence or two.\n- If you have two themes:\n    - Present each theme using a sub-heading\n    - Give the reader a brief overview of what the theme is. It is likely that you will have to select a few key points that encapsulate your theme, rather than describe everything in your theme in detail. For a dissertation, where you have more available word count, you will be able to cover more.\n    - Once you’ve introduced the theme, tell the reader about what you found in your analysis of this theme. Make sure to incorporate quotes to support your analytical points.\n- If you have one theme and two sub-themes:\n    - Have sub-headings for the overall theme as well as the sub-themes.\n    - Briefly explain the overarching theme and then how the sub-themes relate to the larger theme. Do not present quotes at this point.\n    - Then, present each of the sub-themes in turn, under sub-headings. In each of these, tell the reader what you found in the analysis of your theme and incorporate quotes to support your analytical points.\n\n**Presenting Quotes**\n\nUse *long quotes* by placing them in a separate, centred indented block. *Short quotes* can be included within the sentence. Due to the word count, you are likely to be able to do a maximum of one or two longer quotes per theme or sub-theme. \n\nYou can find guidance on presenting participant quotes in APA format [in the recommended resources](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations/quoting-participants){target=\"_blank\"}. Although the word limit suggested here is 40 words, this is quite long and so we suggest taking it on a case by case basis (e.g. having a quote of 39 words within a sentence might be correct but also might be confusing to read). You can run anything past us if you are unsure. \n\nWe have also [prepared an example](https://gla-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/ashley_robertson_glasgow_ac_uk/EWfG8vjCAvtPjYPEJjQWxl8BPHlfzuI6weVkwIh_MVJSTQ?e=x7OT9m){target=\"_blank\"} of how to format quotes in APA style.\n\n**Going Beyond Paraphrasing**\n\nA strong analysis section will *analyse* the data, going beyond summary and paraphrasing. What do you add, as the analyst? You will have much more knowledge of the data, and it is your job to pass on that insight. If you paraphrase the data, the reader will be able to see this in the quotes, but the analysis then doesn’t add anything extra.\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n\nInstead of telling the reader what was talked about, explain **what the things that were talked about reveal or suggest** about the phenomenon you are studying.\n\n:::\n\nAvoid writing themes that are topic summaries, as these are at a descriptive level. \n\n- A theme of “Stress and workload” is mainly descriptive. It tells us the topics that participants mentioned, but not why they matter or how they relate.\n- A theme of “Stress is an unavoidable requirement of ‘being a good student’” is interpretative. It goes further by explaining what stress *means* for the participants. For example, the data might show that students see stress as tied to their identity as students and that this is something that they expect, rather than something to avoid.\n\nThis kind of deeper interpretation goes beyond the superficial to show the reader what the data suggests, rather than just summarising it.\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse=\"false\"}\n\n## Tips\n\n- There is no single “correct” interpretation, but you must show clearly how your interpretation is supported by the quotes you use. \n- Go beyond describing the data—explain the underlying meaning. \n- Choose quotes that directly support the point you are making; the connection should be obvious to the reader. \n- Follow the guidelines: include the recommended number of themes/sub-themes, and balance quotations with your interpretation.\n\n:::\n\n\n#### Discussion (suggested word count: 750-850 words)\n\nSome activities to support you with developing evaluation in your Discussion section can be found in [Chapter 11](#eval_discussion).\n\nThe aim of the discussion is to summarise and explain your overall findings and consider how they help inform the research questions.  It will be necessary to consider the findings in relation to previous research and theories (that are referenced in the Introduction).  You should also discuss any practical implications of your findings, methodological limitations, and suggestions for further research.\n\nStart by **briefly summarising** your RQs and the themes that you have observed. How do your findings add to, or fit with previous research?  You can either take each main theme as a big discussion or break it down to sub-theme theme level. Be critical.  Bring in the literature you discussed in the introduction, and new literature if need be. Do your findings agree/disagree with previous studies? Do your findings challenge existing research in any way? Did your methodology uncover something that the other studies couldn’t get at?   - basically... what is your contribution?\n\n**Implications:** In addition to theoretical implications you would normally discuss in a quantitative report in psychology, there is also scope for discussion of the implications.  Remember to only discuss implications that you can realistically relate to your own findings, and to support your arguments with evidence. Try to over some specifics and not vague/general implications.\n\n**Limitations:** You only used a maximum of three interviews (as we did not want to overload you). However, avoid evaluating your study purely on quantitative standards such as validity and reliability and sample size. We strongly suggest that you do not use lack of generalisation as a limitation.  This can be contradictory to the philosophy of the method of analysis.  Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses on qualitative grounds, e.g., were interviews the best way of eliciting the information for this particular topic?  For guidance on evaluating qualitative research against a set of guidelines see Yardley (2000) & Braun & Clarke (2013, Ch 12).\n\n**Suggestions for future research** How would you improve on your study? If you had the chance what kind of research questions would you like to ask? Make sure these are also evidence-based and make sense following from your study. Limitations and future directions don't necessarily need to be separate sections; often, a future suggestion flows logically from a limitation.\n\nThink of your research project as an apprenticeship. We are not looking for you to do the perfect research project at your first attempt so don’t be shy about pointing out the things you could have done better. But be constructive. It’s not so much about telling us what you did wrong, as telling us what you have learned and how you would improve this study if you got another chance.\n\n**Conclusion:** End your report with a brief paragraph summarising your key conclusions from the study.\n \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Narrow-to-broad structure of a discussion](images/discussion.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Recap of word count for each section of the report\n  * ABSTRACT: 100-150 words\n  * INTRODUCTION: 700-800 words\n  * METHOD: 350-450 words\n  * ANALYSIS: 750-900 words\n  * DISCUSSION: 750-850 words\n\n#### References\n\nReferences both in the main body of text and in the reference list are structured in exactly the same way as in a quantitative report using APA 7th style.\n\n\n#### Appendices\n\nAn appendix (plural: appendices) is a supplementary document which forms part of a main document but is not essential for its completeness, containing supporting information, and usually appearing at the end. \n\nThe appendix can often hold a lot of information.  In the qualitative report we ask you to include the following in the appendices of the report: \n\n  * A list of the interviews you have chosen and a link to the original dataset (you should not include the transcripts themselves) \n  * A sample of initial coding of the transcript \n  * You might also have a list of the interview questions (if easily obtained from your transcripts or study documentation on UK data service) \n  \n  \n#### Further reading\n\nThe RM2 reading list has examples of how qualitative research is presented and written up.  [The APA Reporting Standards for Qualitative Research](https://apastyle.apa.org/jars/qual-table-1.pdf) provide comprehensive guidance on how to write up a qualitative article.  These guidelines are very detailed and go beyond the scope of what you need to report in the qualitative report, but do provide insight into how to report methods and analysis (in particular) in a transparent way. If in doubt consult the guidance on this book chapter,  the assessment information sheet for the course and ask on the Teams channel. \n",
